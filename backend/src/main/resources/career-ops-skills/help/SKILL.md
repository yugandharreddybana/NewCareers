# career-ops Help

Guide the user through available skills based on where they are in their
job search.

## Step 0: Check State

Read `data/profile.yml` - does it exist?
Read `data/applications.md` - how many entries?
Glob `data/evaluations/*.md` - how many evaluations?
Glob `data/resumes/*.html` - how many resumes?

## Step 1: Show Skill Directory

If the user asked about a specific skill, show detailed help for that skill.
Otherwise show the full directory:

```

| **quick-eval** | Fast score + one paragraph (no full report) |
```

## Step 2: Smart Suggestion

Based on the user's current state, suggest the most valuable next action:

**No profile:**
> "Start here: paste your resume or tell me about yourself so I can
> evaluate jobs for you."

**Profile exists, no evaluations:**
> "You're all set! Paste a job posting (URL or text) and I'll evaluate
> how well you match."

**Has evaluations, no resumes:**
> "You have {n} evaluations. Your top match is **{company} - {role}**
> ({score}/5.0). Want me to tailor a resume for it?"

**Has resumes, none applied:**
> "You have resumes ready for {n} roles. Ready to apply? Say 'help me
> with the {company} application' and I'll generate your form answers."

**Has applications:**
> "You have {n} active applications. Say 'show my applications' for a
> status overview, or 'update {company} to {status}' to track progress."

**Has interviews:**
> "You have interviews coming up! Say 'research {company}' to prepare."
