## Notes

- `work_history` is the most important field for accurate evaluations.
  It's populated automatically when you paste your resume during setup.
- `credentials` only matter for regulated industries (Healthcare, Legal,
  Trades, Non-Software Engineering, Finance, Education, Government).
  If your industry doesn't require licenses, leave it empty.
- `persona` modifiers adjust scoring weights. See scoring-rubric.md.
