# Company Research

Build an intelligence brief on a target company.

## Step 1: Gather Data

Use WebSearch to find:

1. **Company basics:** What they do, size, founded, HQ, funding/revenue
2. **Recent news (last 6 months):** Product launches, layoffs, acquisitions,
   leadership changes, funding rounds
3. **Culture signals:** Glassdoor rating + recurring themes, any "best places
   to work" lists or notable controversies
4. **Team/department:** Who leads the department you'd join? Likely hiring
   manager? Team size?
5. **Tech/tools/methodology:** What does this team use? (Check job postings,
   tech blog, team member LinkedIn profiles via web search)

If WebSearch is unavailable:
> "I can share what I know about {company}, but for the latest info
> (recent news, Glassdoor reviews, team changes), enable web search
> in your settings. Here's what I can tell you from general knowledge:"

Then provide what you know, clearly labeled as potentially outdated.

## Step 2: Find Contacts

Search for likely hiring contacts:
- **Hiring manager** (head of the relevant department)
- **Recruiter** (search "{company} recruiter {department}")
- **Team members** (potential peers for informational outreach)

For each contact found: Name, Title, and where you found them.

Note: Do NOT scrape LinkedIn profiles directly. Use web search results
and public company pages only.

## Step 3: Check for Existing Evaluation

Read `data/evaluations/` for any evaluation at this company. If found,
reference it to add context to the brief.

## Step 4: Output

```
## Company Brief: {Company Name}

### Overview
| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | {industry} |
| **Size** | {employee count range} |
| **Founded** | {year} |
| **HQ** | {location} |
| **Revenue/Funding** | {if available} |
| **Website** | {URL} |

### Recent News (Last 6 Months)
- {headline} ({source}, {date})
- ...
(If no news found: "No major recent news found.")

### Culture Snapshot
**Glassdoor:** {rating}/5 ({review count} reviews)
**Positive themes:** {what employees like}
**Negative themes:** {common complaints}
**Work style:** {remote/hybrid/in-office, hours culture}

### Key Contacts
| Name | Title | Source |
|---|---|---|
| {name} | {title} | {where found} |

### Interview Intelligence
- **Company values/mission:** {what they emphasize}
- **Current priorities:** {what they're working on now}
- **Smart questions to ask:**
  1. {question based on recent news or strategy}
  2. {question about team/culture}
  3. {question about role's impact}
- **Topics to handle carefully:** {any sensitive items}
```

## Step 5: Save

Write to `data/research/{company-slug}.md`.

> "Research saved. You can reference it anytime.
>
> Want me to:
> - **Draft outreach** to one of these contacts?
> - **Evaluate a role** at this company? Paste the job posting.
> - **Prepare interview stories** specific to this company?"
