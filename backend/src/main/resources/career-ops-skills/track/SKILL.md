# Application Tracker

View and manage your job applications in one place.

## Step 0: Load Tracker

Read `data/applications.md`. If it doesn't exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Job Applications

| Date Added | Date Applied | Company | Role | Score | Status | Evaluation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Then tell the user:
> "Your tracker is empty. Evaluate a job posting to get started, or
> paste a JD and I'll score it for you."

## Step 1: Parse User Intent

- **No argument / "show tracker" / "my applications":** Display full table + stats
- **Status filter ("show applied" / "what's in interview"):** Filter by status
- **Company filter ("show Stripe"):** Filter by company name
- **Update ("update Acme PM to Interview"):** Change status of matching row
- **Stats ("how's my search going" / "search stats"):** Show summary statistics
- **Delete ("remove the Acme entry"):** Confirm, then remove row

## Step 2: Display

### Full View

Show the table as-is from applications.md, then show stats below it.

### Filtered View

Show only matching rows, then summary:
> "Showing {n} applications with status '{status}'."

### Update Flow

1. Find the matching row (by company + role, fuzzy match OK)
2. Show current status and proposed new status
3. Ask for confirmation:
   > "Update **{Company} - {Role}** from **{old status}** to **{new status}**?"
4. On confirmation, update the row
5. If transitioning to "Applied", set Date Applied to today
6. If transitioning to "Accepted", congratulate them!

Validate transitions against references/states.md. If invalid:
> "Can't move from {old} to {new}. Valid next steps: {list}."

## Step 3: Statistics

```
## Your Job Search Dashboard

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Total evaluated | {n} |
| Resumes tailored | {n with status >= Resume Ready} |
| Applied | {n} |
| Response rate | {responses / applied}% |
| Interviews | {n} |
| Offers | {n} |
| Average score (applied) | {avg}/5.0 |
| Active (not resolved) | {n non-terminal} |

**Top scoring opportunities:**
1. {Company} - {Role} ({score}/5.0) - {status}
2. ...
3. ...

**Needs attention (applied but no response > 7 days):**
- {Company} - {Role} - applied {date}
```

If there are evaluations without resumes tailored:
> "You have {n} evaluations scoring 3.5+ without a tailored resume.
> Want me to create one? Say 'tailor my resume for {top company}'."

## Step 4: Suggest Next Actions

Based on current state:

- Mostly "Evaluated": "You've got evaluations but haven't applied to many.
  Want me to tailor resumes for your top-scored roles?"
- Several "Applied" with no updates: "Time for follow-ups? I can draft
  outreach messages to check in on your applications."
- Has "Interview": "Great, you have interviews! Want me to research
  {company} to help you prepare?"
- Everything terminal: "Your current batch is wrapped up. Ready to scan
  for new opportunities?"
